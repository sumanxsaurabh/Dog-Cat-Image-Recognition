# Dog-Cat-Image-Recognition
CNN project deployment for binary classification. Here, target is to predict whether sample image will be Dog or Cat.

Application URL: https://dog-cat-image-recognition.herokuapp.com/

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data

1. The Dog vs. Cat Dataset
Dogs vs. Cats dataset provided by Microsoft Research contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats with the labels

1 = dog
0 = cat

2. Project goals
Building a deep neural network using TensorFlow to classify dogs and cats images.

Making a Flask application so user can upload their photos and receive the prediction.

3. Project plan
During this project, we need to answer these following questions:

A. Build the model

How to import the data
How to preprocess the images
How to create a model
How to train the model with the data
How to export the model
How to import the model
B. Build the Flask app

Front end

HTML
How to connect frontend to backend
How to draw a number on HTML
How to make UI looks good
Back end

Flask
How to set up Flask
How to handle backend error
How to make real-time prediction
Combine the model with the app
